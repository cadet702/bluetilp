NOTE! These Processing sketches require a client program on the calculator. That program doesn't exist anymore. You've got to write it yourself for now. Use the RX calc program elsewhere in this project to receive coordinates from the programs and turn pixels black. If you look at the source of these programs it should be possible to figure out the format I used. With the right TI-BASIC program these examples will work as expected. Sorry! Good luck!
